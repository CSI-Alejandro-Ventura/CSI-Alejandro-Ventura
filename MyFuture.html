        In the future I want to study business or real estate.
         I want to go to a university that has a good business and basketbal program.
         Mi options are UNC, Duke, UF and UCLA which have a  good business program and have good basketball.
         When I graduate from the university I want to work in the United States or in Dorado Puerto Rico
         which are good places for real estate.
